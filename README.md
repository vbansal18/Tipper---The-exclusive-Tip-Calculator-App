# Tip Calculator

## *Vaibhav Bansal*

**Tipper - The exclusive tip calculator** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount.

* [ ] Improve the user interface through styling and coloring, e.g. change the text color, font,
  optimize the layout for different screens.
* [ ] Add the ability to split the bill across any number of people.
* [ ] Add the ability to round the total bill up or down, which should update the tip amount and
  percent automatically.

  automatically decide the tip percentage.
